# x402 Nano API Documentation

## Overview

The x402 Nano API is a secure, high-performance **payment gateway** for Nano cryptocurrency. Similar to Stripe or PayPal, we provide a REST API for managing wallets, processing payments, and verifying transactions.

> **About the Name:** "x402" is a brand name inspired by payment-required concepts. This is **not** an implementation of the HTTP 402 Payment Required protocol. Instead, we offer a flexible payment processing API designed for merchants, developers, and AI agents.

**Base URL:** `https://api.x402nano.com`

**Protocol:** HTTPS only  
**Format:** JSON  
**Authentication:** API Key (where applicable)

**What We Offer:**
- 💳 Payment gateway functionality (create/verify transactions)
- 👛 Wallet management (create, import, encrypt)
- 💰 Transaction processing (send, receive, balance checks)
- 🤖 AI-friendly API design (perfect for ChatGPT, Claude integration)
- ⚡ Fast, secure, and developer-friendly

---

## Error Handling

All endpoints return standard HTTP status codes:

### Success Codes
- `200 OK` - Request successful
- `201 Created` - Resource created successfully

### Error Codes
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid request parameters
- `401 Unauthorized` - Missing or invalid API key
- `403 Forbidden` - Access denied
- `404 Not Found` - Endpoint or resource not found
- `429 Too Many Requests` - Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server error

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "error": "weak_password",
  "message": "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter"
}
```

### Deep Nested Error Handling

The API uses a **deep nested error handling** approach where errors are constructed at the point of failure:

- Errors originate from the lowest level (e.g., RPC calls, database operations)
- Each layer adds context as the error propagates up
- This provides detailed, actionable error messages that help identify exactly where and why something failed

**Example Error Chain:**
```
RPC Call Failed → Parse Error → API Error Response
"Failed to parse RPC response: Failed to parse accounts_receivable response: unexpected field..."
```

This approach ensures:
- **Precise error location**: Know exactly which operation failed
- **Full context**: See the complete error chain from source to API response
- **Better debugging**: Detailed messages help developers troubleshoot issues quickly

**Common Error Messages:**
- `"weak_password"` - Password doesn't meet requirements
- `"invalid_credentials"` - Wrong password or encrypted wallet string
- `"insufficient_balance"` - Not enough balance to send
- `"invalid_address"` - Malformed Nano address
- `"rpc_error"` - Nano node RPC call failed (includes detailed context)
- `"rpc_response_parse_failed"` - Failed to parse RPC response (includes parse details)
- `"database_error"` - Database operation failed
- `"invalid_api_key"` - API key is invalid or missing (required for wallet operations)

---

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **Default Limit:** 100 requests per minute per IP address
- **API Key Limit:** Higher limits available with API key authentication

When rate limited, the API returns:
```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```

**Headers:**
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when limit resets

---

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never expose your API key** in client-side code or public repositories
2. **Use HTTPS only** - the API enforces TLS/SSL
3. **Store encrypted_wallet_string securely** - treat it like a private key
4. **Use strong passwords** for wallet encryption
5. **Implement request signing** for sensitive operations
6. **Rotate API keys regularly**

### Wallet Security

- **Encrypted Storage:** Wallets are encrypted with AES-256
- **Password Protection:** All wallet operations require password verification
- **No Private Key Exposure:** Private keys never leave the encrypted container
- **Secure Transmission:** All data transmitted over HTTPS

### Best Practices for AI Integration

When integrating this API with AI systems:

1. **Environment Variables:** Store API keys and sensitive data in environment variables
2. **Request Validation:** Always validate user input before making API calls
3. **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for all API responses
4. **Transaction Confirmation:** Always confirm transaction details with users before sending
5. **Balance Checks:** Verify sufficient balance before attempting sends
6. **Audit Logging:** Log all API interactions for security auditing

## Webhooks

### Overview

Webhooks provide instant push notifications when transactions are paid. Instead of polling the status endpoint every few seconds, your server receives an HTTP POST request immediately when payment is confirmed.

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Instant notifications (< 1 second after payment)
- 📉 Reduced server load (no polling needed)
- 🤖 Perfect for AI agents and automation
- 🔄 Automatic retry on delivery failure

### Setup

1. **Create transaction with callback_url:**
```json
POST /api/transactions/create
{
  "receive_address": "nano_...",
  "amount": "1.5",
  "callback_url": "https://yoursite.com/webhook"
}
```

2. **Implement webhook endpoint:**
```python
from flask import Flask, request
import hmac
import hashlib

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    # Get transaction ID from headers
    transaction_id = request.headers.get('X-Transaction-Id', '')
    
    # Get payload
    data = request.json
    
    # Process payment
    order_id = data.get('metadata', {}).get('order_id')
    amount = data['amount']
    
    print(f"Payment received for order {order_id}: {amount} Nano")
    # Mark order as paid, start shipping, etc.
    
    return 'OK', 200
```

3. **Whitelist our server IP (recommended):**
```nginx
# In your firewall/nginx config
location /webhook {
    allow 57.129.16.77;  # x402 Nano server
    deny all;
}
```

### Webhook Payload

**Headers:**
```
Content-Type: application/json
X-Transaction-Id: uuid-123
```

**Body:**
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "receive_address": "nano_1your_server_address",
  "amount": "1.5",
  "metadata": "{\"order_id\":\"ORD-123\"}",
  "paid_at": "2026-01-10T14:30:00Z"
}
```

### Retry Logic

If webhook delivery fails, we automatically retry:
- **Attempt 1:** Immediate
- **Attempt 2:** 30 seconds later
- **Attempt 3:** 5 minutes later

**Success criteria:** HTTP status 200-299

**Logged:** All delivery attempts are logged in database for debugging

### Security

**IP Whitelisting (Recommended)**
- Our server IP: `57.129.16.77`
- Configure your firewall to only accept webhooks from this IP
- This is the most secure and simplest method

**Example verification (Python):**
```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    # Verify IP (optional - can also do at firewall level)
    client_ip = request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-For', request.remote_addr)
    if client_ip != '57.129.16.77':
        return 'Unauthorized', 403
    
    # Process webhook
    data = request.json
    print(f"Payment received: {data['amount']} Nano")
    
    return 'OK', 200
```

## Metadata

### Overview

Metadata allows you to attach custom JSON data to transactions. This is perfect for tracking orders, customers, sessions, or any other contextual information.

**Use Cases:**
- 🛒 E-commerce: Order IDs, customer emails, product details
- 🤖 AI Services: Session IDs, service types, user identifiers
- 📊 API Metering: Endpoint names, usage tiers, billing periods
- 🎮 Gaming: Player IDs, item purchases, in-game transactions

### Usage

**Create transaction with metadata:**
```json
POST /api/transactions/create
{
  "receive_address": "nano_...",
  "amount": "1.5",
  "metadata": "{\"order_id\":\"ORD-123\",\"customer\":\"user@example.com\",\"items\":[\"License\",\"Support\"]}"
}
```

**Retrieve in status check:**
```json
GET /api/transactions/status/{id}
{
  "success": "true",
  "is_paid": true,
  "metadata": "{\"order_id\":\"ORD-123\",\"customer\":\"user@example.com\"}"
}
```

**Receive in webhook:**
```json
POST https://yoursite.com/webhook
{
  "transaction_id": "...",
  "amount": "1.5",
  "metadata": "{\"order_id\":\"ORD-123\"}"
}
```

### Limitations

- **Max size:** 4KB (4096 bytes)
- **Format:** Must be valid JSON string
- **Validation:** Checked on creation, returns error if invalid
- **Storage:** Persisted in PostgreSQL database

### Examples

**E-commerce Order:**
```json
{
  "metadata": "{\"order_id\":\"ORD-12345\",\"customer_email\":\"buyer@example.com\",\"product\":\"Premium License\",\"quantity\":1,\"discount_code\":\"SAVE10\"}"
}
```

**AI Service:**
```json
{
  "metadata": "{\"session_id\":\"sess_abc123\",\"service\":\"GPT-4\",\"model\":\"gpt-4-turbo\",\"tokens\":1500,\"user_id\":\"user_xyz\"}"
}
```

**API Metering:**
```json
{
  "metadata": "{\"api_key\":\"key_123\",\"endpoint\":\"/v1/data\",\"requests\":1000,\"period\":\"2026-01\"}"
}
```
