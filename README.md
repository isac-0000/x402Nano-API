# x402 Nano API - Public Documentation

> 📝 **ABOUT x402 NANO**
> 
> **"x402"** is a brand name inspired by payment-required protocols. This API is a **payment gateway for Nano cryptocurrency** - similar to Stripe or PayPal, but for Nano.
> 
> This is **NOT** an implementation of the HTTP 402 Payment Required status code protocol. Instead, we provide a flexible REST API for payment processing, wallet management, and transaction handling.
> 
> **Think of us as:** "Stripe for Nano" - A modern payment processing API.

> ⚠️ **BETA / TEST PHASE** ⚠️
> 
> This API is currently in **test/beta phase**. Most endpoints are currently publicly accessible for testing purposes.
> 
> **Future Changes:**
> - All endpoints will require API key authentication in production
> - Rate limits will be enforced more strictly
> - Additional security measures will be implemented
> 
> Please check this documentation regularly for updates: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Andre1987n/x402Nano-API)
